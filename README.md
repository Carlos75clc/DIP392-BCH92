## Tips
- Plan your moves ahead to avoid trapping the snake.
- Try to corner apples to make it easier to eat them.
- As the snake grows longer, maneuver carefully to avoid collisions.
- If you want to make the game harder, decrease the value of “var delay = “ (line 9 in the snake.js) to improve the speed of the snake.
